title: Computer Architecture
course_number : CO224 
course_title : Computer Architecture
credits : 3
type : Core 
prerequisites : NULL
aims_and_objectives: To teach the elements of a computer and how they are organized and explain how instructions of a program will be executed by the microprocessor and how performance can be evaluated and enhanced so as to widen the vision of students in understanding programs behaviour on a computer system.
